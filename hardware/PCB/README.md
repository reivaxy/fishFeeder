Here are the gerber file to order PCBs

I left the text file with the coordinates of JLCPCB, a Chinese firm who does a very good job, quickly and for a low price.

For this board, I've ordered 10 pieces for about $10 shipping included.

WARNING: on PCB v1, I was using GPIO9, which should not be used => had to cut a track and add a wire. Also, no decoupling capacitor on the regulator, but it worked fine.

PCB v2 fixes all this, and provides support for infra red sensor.
