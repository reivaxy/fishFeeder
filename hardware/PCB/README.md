Here are the gerber file to order PCBs

I left the text file with the coordinates of JLCPCB, a Chinese firm who does a very good job, quickly and for a low price.

For this board, I've ordered 10 pieces for about $10 shipping included.

WARNING: on PCB v1, I have forgotten capacitors on the LM1117 regulator pins, not sure how it will behave. PCB version v2 will have them.
