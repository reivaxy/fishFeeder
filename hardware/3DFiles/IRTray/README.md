# Infrared sensor tray

This is a new version of the original IRTray.stl file designed to better protect the sensors against water splashes and food crumbs.

Depending on your printer capabilities, you can either :

- print just the IRTrayFullTranslucent.stl file using translucent filament

- or if you printer can print with several materials (like Prusa with MMU2) use both IRTrayInsertTranslucent.stl AND IRTrayShell.stl in one print, and use translucent filament for the former part and whatever color you print the feeder case for the latter.
