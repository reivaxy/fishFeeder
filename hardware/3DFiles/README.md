# Fish feeder 3D files

The case was designed to be printable with no support.

There is a main body, a cover, a back, a motor plate and an archimedes's screw with a small insert.

The screw is printed in two halves that are joined by the bearing at each end.

3 versions are available: 6 rotations, 9 rotations and 12 rotations.

If you need to dispense small quantities, higher rotation count will provide the best accuracy.

Here is a printing positioning suggestion:

I printed the prototype with PLA, and 0.2 mm layers.
