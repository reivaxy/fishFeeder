The case was designed to be printable with no support.

There is a main body, a cover, a back, a motor plate and an archimedes's screw with a small insert.

The screw is printed in two halves that are joined by the bearing at each end.

3 versions of the screw are available: 6 rotations, 9 rotations and 12 rotations.

If you need to dispense small quantities, higher rotation count will provide the best accuracy.

The stepper plate could be replaced by another one to accomodate a different stepper if within the overall dimensions, withouth a need to redesign the full case.

The holes to attach the stepper to the plate using hex bolts are blind: this is a printing trick to have a decent result. You just need to push the screw through the first time to break the thin layer, and may be clean up a little bit with a scalpel.




Here is a printing positioning suggestion:

I printed the prototype with PLA, and 0.2 mm layers.
