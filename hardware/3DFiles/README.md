The case was designed to be printable with no support, except for the "roof" of the IRInsert opening that may need some basic supports.

The archimedes's screw is printed in two halves that are joined by the bearing at each end. There is no need to glue the two halves together.

3 versions of the screw are available: 6 rotations, 9 rotations and 12 rotations.

If you need to dispense small quantities, higher rotation count will provide the best accuracy.

The stepper plate could be replaced by another one to accomodate a different stepper if within the overall dimensions, withouth a need to redesign the full case.

The holes to attach the stepper to the plate using hex bolts are printed "blind": this is a printing trick to have a decent result when printing overhung holes without supports. You just need to push the screw through the first time to break the thin layer, and may be clean up a little bit with a scalpel.

There are several options to fix the case to the aquarium in the "foot" directory, they all offer the case rotation on the vertical axis (thanks to a printed big screw whose two halves need to be printed horizontally), one offers translating back and forward. This needs more documenting coming soon.


The back comes in two flavors, a plain one that you print as usual, and a bi-color one that features arrows on top of the push button holes, that you can print with a printer handling several colors (2 heads, Prusa MMU, or Palette)

The tray for Infra Red sensors comes in two flavors too, check the IRTray directory README.

If you need a bigger food tank two extensions that clip on top of the case are available (20 or 45mm) and can easily be customized to fit whatever need.

Check the wiki for details on printing each part.
